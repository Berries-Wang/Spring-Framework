= Basic Concepts: `@Bean` and `@Configuration`

The central artifacts in Spring's Java configuration support are
`@Configuration`-annotated classes and `@Bean`-annotated methods.

The `@Bean` annotation is used to indicate that a method instantiates, configures, and
initializes a new object to be managed by the Spring IoC container. For those familiar
with Spring's `<beans/>` XML configuration, the `@Bean` annotation plays the same role as
the `<bean/>` element. You can use `@Bean`-annotated methods with any Spring
`@Component`. However, they are most often used with `@Configuration` beans.

Annotating a class with `@Configuration` indicates that its primary purpose is as a
source of bean definitions. Furthermore, `@Configuration` classes let inter-bean
dependencies be defined by calling other `@Bean` methods in the same class.
The simplest possible `@Configuration` class reads as follows:

[tabs]
======
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
	@Configuration
	public class AppConfig {

		@Bean
		public MyServiceImpl myService() {
			return new MyServiceImpl();
		}
	}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
----
	@Configuration
	class AppConfig {

		@Bean
		fun myService(): MyServiceImpl {
			return MyServiceImpl()
		}
	}
----
======

The preceding `AppConfig` class is equivalent to the following Spring `<beans/>` XML:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<beans>
		<bean id="myService" class="com.acme.services.MyServiceImpl"/>
	</beans>
----

.@Configuration classes with or without local calls between @Bean methods?
****
In common scenarios, `@Bean` methods are to be declared within `@Configuration` classes,
ensuring that full configuration class processing applies and that cross-method
references therefore get redirected to the container's lifecycle management.
This prevents the same `@Bean` method from accidentally being invoked through a regular
Java method call, which helps to reduce subtle bugs that can be hard to track down.

When `@Bean` methods are declared within classes that are not annotated with
`@Configuration` - or when `@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods=false)` is declared -,
they are referred to as being processed in a "lite" mode. In such scenarios,
`@Bean` methods are effectively a general-purpose factory method mechanism without
special runtime processing (that is, without generating a CGLIB subclass for it).
A custom Java call to such a method will not get intercepted by the container and
therefore behaves just like a regular method call, creating a new instance every time
rather than reusing an existing singleton (or scoped) instance for the given bean.

As a consequence, `@Bean` methods on classes without runtime proxying are not meant to
declare inter-bean dependencies at all. Instead, they are expected to operate on their
containing component's fields and, optionally, on arguments that a factory method may
declare in order to receive autowired collaborators. Such a `@Bean` method therefore
never needs to invoke other `@Bean` methods; every such call can be expressed through
a factory method argument instead. The positive side-effect here is that no CGLIB
subclassing has to be applied at runtime, reducing the overhead and the footprint.

The `@Bean` and `@Configuration` annotations are discussed in depth in the following sections.
First, however, we cover the various ways of creating a Spring container by using
Java-based configuration.
